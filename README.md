Following the Fireverse v1 disaster, because I was a beginner in php and I had forgotten a lot of useful things (like an api, security, and more...), I decided to do a Fireverse redesign.
It will not be in the master branch but in the v2 branch, which will be the beta version of v2.
There will also be the dev branch, a branch that is often updated and more unstable than the beta.
Thank you!
