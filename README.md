# Information
Following the Fireverse v1 disaster, because I was a beginner in php and I had forgotten a lot of useful things (like an api, security, and more...), I decided to do a Fireverse redesign.
It will not be in the master branch but in the v2 branch, which will be the beta version of v2.
There will also be the dev branch, a branch that is often updated and more unstable than the beta.
Thank you!
# But what will happen in the master branch while the v2 is being developed?
What will happen while the v2 is being developed will be that the files from the v1 remain.
You can still use it, but it is highly discouraged, because it is not at all ergonomic and with few features and is really not secure.
